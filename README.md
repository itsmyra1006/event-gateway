## ✨ Features

* **Seamless User Registration:** A clean, user-friendly form for event registration.
* **Unique QR Code Generation:** Each participant receives a unique QR code.
* **Email Integration:** QR codes are automatically emailed to participants, ensuring they have a copy.
* **Duplicate Registration Handling:** Re-registering with the same email/ID re-sends the original QR code instead of creating a duplicate entry.
* **Web-Based QR Scanner:** A mobile-friendly scanner page for organizers to mark attendance in real-time.
* **Live Admin Dashboard:** A dashboard that auto-refreshes every 5 seconds to show live attendance statistics.
* **Export to Excel:** Admins can download the complete attendance list as an `.xlsx` file with one click.
* **Secure Database Clearing:** A hidden button on the admin dashboard, accessible only with a secret key, allows for wiping all entries before a new event.
* **Light/Dark Mode:** A persistent theme toggle (☀️/🌙) for user preference across all pages.

## ⚙️ Setup for Local Development

To run this project on your own machine for further development:

1.  **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project folder.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/itsmyra1006/event-gateway](https://github.com/itsmyra1006/event-gateway)
    cd event-gateway
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the `Event-Gateway` root directory.
    * This file stores the secret credentials needed to run the application. Add the following, replacing the placeholder values:
        ```
        # Connect to your cloud DB for local development
        DATABASE_URL=your_external_database_url_from_render

        # Your Gmail credentials
        EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
        EMAIL_PASS=your-16-digit-gmail-app-password

        # Secret key to reveal the 'Clear Database' button
        ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=choose_a_very_secret_password
        ```
    * You can get the `DATABASE_URL` from your PostgreSQL instance on Render under the **"Connect"** tab (use the **"External Database URL"**).

4.  **Add Development Script:**
    * For a better development experience with auto-restarting, add a `"dev"` script to your `package.json`:
        ```json
        "scripts": {
          "start": "node index.js",
          "dev": "nodemon index.js"
        },
        ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:3001`.
