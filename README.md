## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup for Local Development

To run this project on your own machine for further development:

1.  **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project folder.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/itsmyra1006/NSCC_Submission.git](https://github.com/itsmyra1006/NSCC_Submission.git)
    cd NSCC-Submission/Event-Gateway
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the `Event-Gateway` root directory.
    * This file stores the secret credentials needed to run the application. Add the following, replacing the placeholder values:
        ```
        # Connect to your cloud DB for local development
        DATABASE_URL=your_external_database_url_from_render

        # Your Gmail credentials
        EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
        EMAIL_PASS=your-16-digit-gmail-app-password

        # Secret key to reveal the 'Clear Database' button
        ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=choose_a_very_secret_password
        ```
    * You can get the `DATABASE_URL` from your PostgreSQL instance on Render under the **"Connect"** tab (use the **"External Database URL"**).

4.  **Add Development Script:**
    * For a better development experience with auto-restarting, add a `"dev"` script to your `package.json`:
        ```json
        "scripts": {
          "start": "node index.js",
          "dev": "nodemon index.js"
        },
        ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:3001`.
